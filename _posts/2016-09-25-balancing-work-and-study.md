title: Balancing work and study
---

For the past six months since I started my current job, I've been finishing my degree
off part time, fitting in time to study in the evenings and on weekends. What began as
a way for me to travel in the middle of my studies has ended up giving me a whole new
perspective on the meaning of hard work. When I began, I would never have imagined just how difficult it can be
to come home and study after a day in the office!

## Studying full time and working

While I was attending university full time, I
held several different jobs, including work as a waiter, construction labourer,
and bartender. Generally the work would take place
on weekends or in the evenings. When I was attending lectures during the day, or labs/seminars,
it didn't matter so much if you turn up to work afterwards feeling mentally drained; I'd just
get my work done, and head home. I assumed once I switched to part time study, the same kind of approach could work in reverse - head in to work, come home and study for a few hours, and then relax.

## Studying part time

During the first year of part time study, while I worked as a waiter full time after returning from travelling,
things were generally as expected. Finish my shift, head home, study for a couple of hours, go to bed.
It did take more out of me than I'd expected, and I found I had less energy than I used to for getting out
on my days off; normally I would just study some more, or work on side projects. Then I got the offer of a position as a developer, to start in March of this year, which I accepted.

That's when the real fun started!

## Context switching

One thing to bear in mind if you are considering part time study is how mentally taxing your job is. For me,
during those first few months as I started to get my head around our workflow and the project architecture, it
was really suprising just how tired I felt at the end of the day. I'd been sitting down in a cushy office, yet
in the evenings I felt just as tired as when I used to come home from a day of manual labor. My arms didn't ache,
but just focusing on simple maths was a real challenge.

I think the problem was to do with switching context from a programming mindset to a mathematics/study mindset.
After coming home, there would be a hour or so period after starting before I could get "in the zone" - over the weeks
and months, the extra time spent switching context really adds up.

## Reaching the end

Just last week I handed in the final draft of my dissertation. Having completed my exams earlier in the summer,
this was the last step for me. It was a lot harder than I had anticipated; not at all like when you can spend all
your productive, thinking time on learning - I found I had to try and split my energy between work and study, and
it didn't leave me with much left over.

Working as a programmer, you are constantly learning as part of your day to day. This feels more manageable to me now -
the experience has definitely taught me the value of time, and when to take some for yourself.
Would I do another degree, or masters, part time? Maybe in the future - right now I'm taking a well deserved study break!

However, I'm glad I finished my degree off part time. It was one of the most rewarding things I've done, and I would thoroughly recommend anyone looking at higher education to consider part time study.
