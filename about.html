<p>I discovered my passion for development while I was studying for my degree in Physics,
at the University of Exeter. With my mathematical background, I began with scientific
programming; first in C, and later moving on to Python. My first large side project was
an n-body simulator built with numPy, and rendered with matplotlib.</p>

<p>Later I branched out to other languages and technologies. Java opened the door to developing
native apps for android, and I've recently been working in javascript, with React and
AngularJS. I'm currently working as an engineer for <a href="http://dabapps.co.uk/">DabApps</a>;
since I joined we have built several hybrid mobile apps, using React Native and Ionic. I also
really enjoy working on the backend, where we use Django and Django REST framework.</p>

<p>Outside of work and side projects, my interests include surfing, playing music,
and experiencing all the great culture on offer in Brighton.</p>
