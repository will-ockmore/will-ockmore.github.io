<h1>About me</h1>
<p>I work for <a href="http://dabapps.co.uk/">DabApps</a> as a Software Engineer, on a wide range
of web and mobile applications. Previously I studied for a degree in physics.</p>

<p>I discovered my passion for development while I was working towards my degree at the University of Exeter. With my mathematical background, I began with scientific programming, first in C and later in Python. My first collaborative project was an n-body simulator built with numPy, and rendered with matplotlib.</p>

<p>Later I branched out to other languages and technologies. Java opened the door to developing
native apps for android, and I've recently been working in javascript, with React, React Native and
AngularJS. On the backend, we use Django and Django REST framework.</p>

<p>Outside of work and side projects, my interests include surfing, playing music,
and experiencing all the great culture on offer in Brighton.</p>
