<h1>About me</h1>
<p>I work for <a href="http://dabapps.co.uk/">DabApps</a> as a Software Engineer, on a wide range
of web and mobile applications.</p>

<p>I began in the field of scientific programming, while studying at the University of Exeter;
first in C and later in Python. My first collaborative project was an n-body simulator built with
numPy, and rendered with matplotlib.</p>

<p>Having previously developed native apps for android, I've recently been working in javascript, with React, React Native and
AngularJS. On the backend, we tend to use Django and Django REST framework. Recently I've also been experimenting with Haskell and pure functional
programming.</p>

<p>Outside of work you might find me surfing, listening to/playing music, chilling in one of Brighton's numerous coffee shops, or having a beer (or two) with friends.</p>

<p><em>See my most recent side project <a href="http://willockmore.com/MovieLists/">here</a> - an IMDb-like,
using the excellent <a href="http://willockmore.com/MovieLists/">themoviedb</a> API. Trying out the new
snapshot testing with Jest (and brushing up my design skills!). See the source on
<a href="http://willockmore.com/MovieLists/">github.</a></em>
