title: About me
---

I'm a software developer based in London. This is my personal blog, it's mostly software / tech related. My favourite technologies to use include python,
pandas / spark / scipy (and the rest of the scientific / ML python stack), javascript / typescript (both frontend and serverside), and React.

I love functional programming, and Haskell in particular. In my day job I spend time fiddling with AWS and getting microservices to behave.

I'm [@will_ockmore](https://twitter.com/will_ockmore) on twitter, and you can reach me at [will.ockmore@gmail.com](mailto:will.ockmore@gmail.com).
